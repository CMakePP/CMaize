CMaize greatly simplifies the process of creating a build system for projects
by allowing users to create a single ``CMakeLists.txt`` file at the root of
their project. This file handles the finding and building of the projects
**executables**, **libraries**, **tests**, as well as any **dependencies**
of the project. Many projects can be built using only the commands provided in
CMaize's user API. Here is a brief overview of the features CMaize provides:

==============
Add Executable
==============

The ``cpp_add_executable`` command allows you to add an executable by providing
the executable's source directories, include directories, and dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

    cpp_add_executable(
        your_executable_name
        SOURCE_DIR /path/to/your/executable/source/dir
        INCLUDE_DIR /path/to/your/executable/include/dir
        DEPENDS dependency1 dependency2
    )

This command will add an executable to the project using the specified source
and include directories and find or build all of the executable's dependencies.

===========
Add Library
===========

The ``cpp_add_library`` command allows you to add a library by providing the
library's source and include directories and all of the library's dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

   cpp_add_library(
       your_library_name
       SOURCE_DIR /path/to/your/library/source/dir
       INCLUDE_DIR /path/to/your/library/include/dir
       DEPENDS dependency1 dependency2
   )

The above snippet will automatically find your library's header and source
files, create and configure a CMake build target for your library, generate the
packaging files for your library, configure an install target, and
and find or build all of the library's dependencies.

========
Add Test
========

The ``cpp_add_tests`` command allows you to add tests to your project by
providing the source directory for the tests and the tests' dependencies:

.. code-block:: cmake

    cpp_add_tests(
        your_tests_name
        SOURCE_DIR "path/to/your/tests/directory"
        DEPENDS dependency1 dependency2
    )

This command will add all the tests that it finds in the source directory,
find or build the dependencies, and create an executable that runs the tests.

========================
Find or Build Dependency
========================

The real power of CMaize is that it makes it easy to integrate dependencies into
your project's build system. For example, if one of your project's libraries
depends on a dependency `name_of_dependency` you can use the
``cpp_find_or_build_dependency`` command to find the dependency:

.. code-block:: cmake

    cpp_find_or_build_dependency(
        name_of_dependency
        URL github.com/an_organization/the_dependency
        BUILD_TARGET the_dependency
        FIND_TARGET  the_dependency::the_dependency
    )

This relatively small snippet will properly look for the dependency using
CMake's `find_package` command. If the dependency is not found, CMaize will
then build it using CMake's `FetchContent` module.
