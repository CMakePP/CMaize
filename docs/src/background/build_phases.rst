Build Phases
############

From the perspective of a user building a project which relies on CMake for its
build system, the build process has several phases. The phases, in order, are
described below.

.. _configure_phase:

***************
Configure Phase

TODO: Write me!!!

.. _compile_phase:

*************
Compile Phase
*************

.. note::

   This phase is often referred to as the "build phase"; however, that leads to
   confusion with the term for set of phases, *i.e.*, build phases. For this
   reason we refer to this phase as the "compile phase" even if it does not
   actually require compiling.

TODO: Write me!!!

.. _test_phase:

**********

.. _install_phase:
