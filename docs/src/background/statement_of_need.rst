The vast majority of build systems written for CMake are verbose and highly
redundant. Generally speaking, it seems that the broader CMake community has
accepted that this "is simply the way CMake build systems are" and has stopped
trying to improve them. Evidence for this claim comes from tutorials prominently
showcasing boilerplate code, the growing reliance on template repositories, and
the tried and true technique of copy/paste-ing CMake scripts from one project
into another. All of these approaches run afoul of the
`"Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)" <https://tinyurl.com/28x7h46c>`__ paradigm and
subsequently suffer from the same problems proponents of DRY seek
to avoid, *e.g.*, multiple sources of truth, lack of synchronization,
and coupling the logic of distinct units of code.

Given that CMake is a full-featured coding language, it is possible to write
abstractions as CMake extensions which will reduce the verbosity and redundancy,
but this is not often done. We speculate that the primary hurdle to developing
such abstractions is lack of support. Most support for scientific software is
aimed at method development and not at software maintenance/sustainability. As
a result build systems are low priority. This is why CMaize is needed. CMaize
will be a reusable, :term:`build tool` built on top of CMake designed to
streamline writing build systems, particularly build systems of scientific
software.
