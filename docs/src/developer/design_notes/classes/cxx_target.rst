CXX Build Target Classes
************************

The ``CXXTarget`` class contains much of the process of building a
CXX target, except for the creation of the different target types (for 
example, CMake's ``add_library()`` vs ``add_executable()`` calls).
``CXXTarget`` is the common parent class for the concrete CXX build targets,
``CXXLibrary``, ``CXXInterfaceLibrary``, and ``CXXExecutable``.

Usage
=====

The concrete build target classes, ``CXXLibrary``, ``CXXInterfaceLibrary``,
and ``CXXExecutable`` should be instantiated with unique target name
strings. Once instantiated, a call to ``CXXTarget(make_target`` will set
up the target with desired properties provided as optional, named parameters.
A list of all parameter options can be found in the function documentation
for ``CXXTarget(make_target``.

For example, a CXX library with known lists of source and include files that
specifically uses the CXX 14 standard can be specified as follows:

.. code-block:: CMake
   
   include(cmaize/cmaize)

   # Create a list of include files
   list(APPEND include_files
       include/example_file_1.hpp
       include/example_file_2.hpp
       include/example_dir/example_file_3.hpp
   )

   # Create a list of source code files
   list(APPEND source_files
       src/example_file_1.cpp
       src/example_file_2.cpp
       src/example_dir/example_file_3.cpp
   )

   # Create a CXX library object named "example_library_name"
   CXXLibrary(CTOR lib_obj example_library_name)

   # Call ``CXXTarget(make_target`` with optional parameters INCLUDES,
   # SOURCES, and CXX_STANDARD to provide include files, source files, and
   # the specific CXX standard to use when building this target.
   CXXLibrary(make_target
       "${lib_obj}"
       INCLUDES "${include_files}"
       SOURCES "${source_files}"
       CXX_STANDARD 14
   )
