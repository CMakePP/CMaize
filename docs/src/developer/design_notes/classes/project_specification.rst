ProjectSpecification Class
**************************

The ``ProjectSpecification`` class is envisioned as holding all of the
details about how to build a project (project being a catchall for a
dependency or the project the CMaize build system is actually being written
for). This includes things like where the source code lives, the version
to build, specific options for configuring, etc. ``ProjectSpecification``
instances will ultimately be used to request packages from the
``PackageManager``.
