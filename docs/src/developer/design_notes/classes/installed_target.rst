*********************
InstalledTarget Class
*********************

This class encompasses pre-built and pre-installed targets on the system.
Since they are already installed, CMaize does not need to build them, so 
the ``InstalledTarget`` class is essentially just a wrapper for the root
directory of the installation.

.. note::

   The root directory for the installation must exist at the time of
   instantiation.
