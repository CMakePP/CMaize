.. function:: _cpp_naive_cxx_package(<src> <install> <prefix>)

    Writes out a C++ package that uses CMake naively.
    
    For our purposes a naive usage of CMake amounts to not writing a
    ``XXX-config.cmake`` file upon installation. This function will generate the
    source code and the ``CMakeLists.txt`` for such a package. The source code
    will be generated by :ref:`cpp_dummy_cxx_library-label`.
    
    :param src: An identifier which, after this call, will store the path to the
        directory containing the source code.
    :param install: An identifier which, after this call, will store he path to
        the install directory for the packge.
    :param prefix: The path where the directory containing the files should live.
    
    :kwargs:
    
        * *NAME* (``option``) - The name of the dependency. Defaults to "dummy".
