.. function:: cpp_find_or_build_dependency()

    Function for building a dependency if we can not locate it.
    
    This function is the public API for users who want CPP to build a dependency
    if it can not be found.

          source code is version controlled with git.
        * *PRIVATE* (``toggle``) - If present, specifies that the URL points to
          a private GitHub repository. The repository will be accessed using the
          value of ``CPP_GITHUB_TOKEN``.
