<p>CMaize is a CMake module designed to streamline writing
<a class="reference internal" href="../../background/terminology.html#term-build-system"><span class="xref std std-term">build systems</span></a> for scientific software. Initial focus is
on
C++-based <a class="reference internal" href="../../background/terminology.html#term-project"><span class="xref std std-term">projects</span></a>, but support for any language CMake
supports
is straightforward.</p>

</div>
<p>The vast majority of build systems written for CMake are verbose and highly
redundant. Generally speaking, it seems that the broader CMake community has
accepted that this “is simply the way CMake build systems are” and has stopped
trying to improve them. Evidence for this claim comes from tutorials prominently
showcasing boilerplate code, the growing reliance on template repositories, and
the tried and true technique of copy/paste-ing CMake scripts from one project
into another. All of these approaches run afoul of the <a class="reference internal" href="../../background/terminology.html#term-DRY"><span class="xref std std-term">DRY</span></a> paradigm and
subsequently suffer from the same problems proponents of DRY seek
to avoid, <em>e.g.</em>, multiple sources of truth, lack of synchronization,
and coupling the logic of distinct units of code.</p>
<p>Given that CMake is a full-featured coding language, it is possible to write
abstractions as CMake extensions which will reduce the verbosity and redundancy,
but this is not often done. We speculate that the primary hurdle to developing
such abstractions is lack of support. Most support for scientific software is
aimed at method development and not at software maintenance/sustainability. As
a result build systems are low priority. This is why CMaize is needed. CMaize
will be a reusable, <a class="reference internal" href="../../background/terminology.html#term-build-tool"><span class="xref std std-term">build tool</span></a> built on top of CMake designed to
streamline writing build systems, particularly build systems of scientific
software.</p>

maintainers. Thus the build system the user writes should rely on the
CMake scripting language.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="#fig-architecture"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a> illustrates the overall architecture of CMaize.
Following from <a class="reference internal" href="#cmake-based-build-system"><span class="std std-ref">cmake-based build system</span></a> all CMaize infrastructure is
built on traditional CMake (denoted by the box labeled “CMake” at the bottom
of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-architecture"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a>). Classes in the “Components”
box are written using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CMakePP/CMakePPLang">CMakePP Language</a>, which is a CMake
module providing the infrastructure necessary to write object-oriented CMake
scripts.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>In the following subsections we introduce the major components of CMaize.
Many of these components are named for the primary class responsible for
the component. To distinguish between the class and the component we adopt
the convention that the component is referred to with normal text whereas the
class is referred to in a code snippet. For example, CMaizeProject refers to
the component and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMaizeProject</span></code> refers to the class.</p>

require us to write a functional-style user API over top of the classes CMaize
relies on. The “User API” component is responsible for collecting the project’s
information and forwarding it to the underlying classes. Since users interact
exclusively with CMaize through the User API component, and the User API
is only charged with collecting information, it also helps address the

sorts, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CMaizeProject</span></code> objects also

are charged with describing the actual package. This includes, for example,
knowing where the libraries and header files are located, as well as supporting
the consumption of the package. The reason this component is called the Target
component, and not the Package component, is because the component
is actually charged with describing the pieces of the package. Put another way,
a package is just a collection of targets.</p>
