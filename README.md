# Features

- Minimize boilerplate. CMake is verbose, CMaize isn't.
- Automatically keep up with CMake's ever changing best practices. CMaize 
  provides a stable API and maintains the mapping from that API to CMake's
  current best practices.
- Seamlessly integrate targets that rely on languages not supported by CMake.
  Currently limited to Python, but can be extended.

# Install

If you are using CMaize as part of your project's build system it is 
recommended that you set up your build system to automatically fetch CMaize. See
[here](https://cmakepp.github.io/CMaize/getting_started/using_cmaize_as_build_system/obtaining_cmaize.html)
for more details.
