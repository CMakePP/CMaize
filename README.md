[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cmakepackagingproject/badge/?version=latest)](https://cmakepackagingproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

CMaize is the top-level project of the CMakePP organization. It is this project

Consequently, CMaize's documentation is the documentation to consult for
generic help when it comes to building a project that uses CMakePP.
