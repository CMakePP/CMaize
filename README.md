[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cmakepackagingproject/badge/?version=latest)](https://cmakepackagingproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

CMaize is the top-level project of the CMakePP organization. It is this project
which package maintainers should use to write their projects' build systems.
Consequently, CMaize's documentation is the documentation to consult for
generic help when it comes to building a project that uses CMakePP.
