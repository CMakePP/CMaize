.. py:class:: CMaizeProject

   The ``CMaizeProject`` provides a workspace to collect information about a
   project, using that information to build and package the project.
   
   This object will **not** create a CMake project if one does not already
   exist.
   
   **Usage:**
   
   A ``CMaizeProject`` object will be automatically created for the current
   when CMaize is included in a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file if a ``project()``
   call has already been made. This project should not be created manually
   in most cases.
   
   To retrieve an existing project object, call:
   
   .. code-block:: cmake
   
      cpp_get_global(result_object CMAIZE_PROJECT_<project_name>)
   
   **Additional Constructors**

   .. py:method:: CTOR(_ctor_name[, ...])

      Creates a ``CMaizeProject`` object. A CMake project of the same name
      must already be created through a ``project()`` call and must be
      the active project.
      
      :param self: The constructed object.
      :type self: CMaizeProject*
      :param _ctor_name: Name of the project. Must match the active project
                         named in ``PROJECT_NAME``.
      :type _ctor_name: desc
      
      :Keyword Arguments:
         * **LANGUAGES** (*list[desc]*) --
           Languages supported by the project. These languages are passed to
           the LANGUAGES keyword of the CMake ``project()`` call if the project
           does not exist yet.
      
      :raises ProjectNotFound: The active CMake project does not match the
                               given project name.
      
      :returns: ``self`` will be set to the newly constructed
                ``CMaizeProject`` object.
      :rtype: CMaizeProject

   **Methods**

   .. py:method:: add_language(_al_language)

      Add a language to the project. Duplicate languages will be removed.
      
      :param self: CMaizeProject object.
      :type self: CMaizeProject
      :param _al_language: Language to be added.
      :type _al_language: desc
      


   .. py:method:: add_package_manager(_apm_pm)

      Add a package manager to the project. Duplicate package manager types
      will not be added.
      
      :param self: CMaizeProject object.
      :type self: CMaizeProject
      :param _apm_pm: Package manager object to be added.
      :type _apm_pm: Package manager
      


   .. py:method:: add_target(_at_target_name, _at_target[, ...])

      Add a target to the project. Duplicate objects will be removed.
      
      :param _at_target_name: Identifying name for the target. This can match
                              name of either the CMake target or CMaizeTarget
                              object, but is required to do match them.
      :type _at_target_name: desc
      :param _at_target: CMaizeTarget object to be added.
      :type _at_target: CMaizeTarget
      :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments may be necessary.
      
      :Keyword Arguments:
         * **INSTALLED** (*bool*) --
           Flag to indicate that the target being added is already installed
           on the system.
         * **NAME** (*desc* or *target*) --
           Identifying name for the target. This can match name of either the
           CMake target or CMaizeTarget object, but is required to do match
           them. This keyword argument is **required**.
      


   .. py:method:: _add_target(__at_target[, ...])

      Add a target to the project. Duplicate objects will not be added.
      
      This internal implementation exists so a required keyword argument is
      not part of the public interface, as well as to handle both ``desc`` and
      ``target`` types. Both types are effectively strings representing target
      names in this algorithm and can be treated equivalently, but cannot be
      typecast to each other by CMakePPLang. The CMakePPLang type checking
      is bypassed through the aforementioned required keyword argument for
      the target name, essentially combining the two types.
      
      :param __at_target: CMaizeTarget object to be added.
      :type __at_target: CMaizeTarget
      :param NAME: Required keyword argument. See description below.
      :type NAME: desc or target
      :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments may be necessary.
      
      :Keyword Arguments:
         * **INSTALLED** (*bool*) --
           Flag to indicate that the target being added is already installed
           on the system.
         * **NAME** (*desc* or *target*) --
           Identifying name for the target. This can match name of either the
           CMake target or CMaizeTarget object, but is required to do match
           them. This keyword argument is **required**.
      


   .. py:method:: check_package_manager(_cpm_found, _cpm_pm_type)

      Checks if a package manager with the same type is already added to
      this project.
      
      :param self: CMaizeProject object.
      :type self: CMaizeProject
      :param _cpm_found: Return variable for if the package manager was found.
      :type _cpm_found: bool*
      :param _cpm_tgt: Package manager to search for.
      :type _cpm_tgt: Package manager
      
      :returns: Package manager found (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
      :rtype: bool
      

      :param _cpm_pm_type: 

      :type _cpm_pm_type: desc

      :param _ct_found: Return variable for if the target was found.
      :type _ct_found: bool*
      :param _ct_target_name: Identifying name for the target. This can match
                              name of either the CMake target or CMaizeTarget
                              object, but is required to do match them.
      :type _ct_target_name: desc
      :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments may be necessary.
      
      :Keyword Arguments:
         * **INSTALLED** (*bool*) --
           Flag to indicate that the installed targets should be checked.
         * **ALL** (*bool*) --
           Flag to indicate that both the build and installed targets should
           be checked.
         * **NAME** (*desc* or *target*) --
           Identifying name for a target contained in the current Cmaize
           project. This keyword argument is **required**.
      
      :returns: CMaizeTarget found (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
      :rtype: bool

      is bypassed through the aforementioned required keyword argument for

      :param __ct_found: Return variable for whether the target was found.
      :type __ct_found: bool*
      :param NAME: Required keyword argument. See description below.
