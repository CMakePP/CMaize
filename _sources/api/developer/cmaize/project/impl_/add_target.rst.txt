.. module:: cmaize.project/impl_/add_target


.. function:: _add_target(self __at_target **kwargs)

   Add a target to the project. Duplicate objects will not be added.
   
   This internal implementation exists so a required keyword argument is
   not part of the public interface, as well as to handle both ``desc`` and
   ``target`` types. Both types are effectively strings representing target
   names in this algorithm and can be treated equivalently, but cannot be
   typecast to each other by CMakePPLang. The CMakePPLang type checking
   is bypassed through the aforementioned required keyword argument for
   the target name, essentially combining the two types.
   
   :param __at_target: CMaizeTarget object to be added.
   :type __at_target: CMaizeTarget
   :param NAME: Required keyword argument. See description below.
   :type NAME: desc or target
   :param **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments may be necessary.
   
   :Keyword Arguments:
      * **INSTALLED** (*bool*) --
        Flag to indicate that the target being added is already installed
        on the system.
      * **NAME** (*desc* or *target*) --
        Identifying name for the target. This can match name of either the
        CMake target or CMaizeTarget object, but is required to do match
        them. This keyword argument is **required**.
