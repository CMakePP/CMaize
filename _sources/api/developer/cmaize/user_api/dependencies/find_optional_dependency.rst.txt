.. module:: cmaize.user_api/dependencies/find_optional_dependency


.. function:: cmaize_find_optional_dependency(_cfod_name _cfod_flag)

   Wraps the process of finding an optional dependency.
   
   Many build systems have optional dependencies. The inclusion of the dependency
   is usually controlled with a flag (e.g., a variable like ``ENABLE_XXX`` for
   an optional dependency ``XXX``). Because of CMake's verbose nature the logic
   for whether or not the dependency is enabled is usually needed in a few
   places. CMaize is capable of automatically propagating the logic for the
   user, as long as the user tells CMaize the flag that controls the inclusion of
   of the dependency.
   
   When the dependency is enabled this function essentially wraps
   ``cmaize_find_dependency`` and the user should consult the documentation for
   ``cmaize_find_dependency`` to understand the full set of options. When enabled
   CMaize will add a compile definition to the target with the same name as the
   flag (common practice for optional dependencies is to use such a definition
   for enabling/disabling sections of source code).
   
   When the dependency is disabled this function simply creates an interface
   target to serve as a placedholder for the dependency. The interface target
   has no state and linking to/installing the target does nothing.
   
   :param name: The name of the dependency.
   :type name: desc
   :param flag: The variable to use as a flag. Used to name the compile
      definition.
   :type flag: desc
   :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to forward to ``cmaize_find_dependency``.
      See the documentation for ``cmaize_find_dependency`` for the full list.
   
   :raises PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND: CMaize was unable to locate the package specified.
       Strong throw guarantee.
   :raises UNKNOWN_PM: ``PACKAGE_MANAGER`` does not correspond to a known
       package manager. Strong throw guarantee.
