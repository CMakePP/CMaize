.. module:: cmaize.user_api/dependencies/find_dependency


.. function:: cmaize_find_dependency(_cfd_name)

   Wraps finding a dependency that CMaize can not build.
   
   There are some dependencies which are not easily built, or whose build process
   takes a long time (and thus should be pre-installed). Such dependencies are
   still needed in build systems, but the build system will not be able to build
   them if they are not already installed. This function wraps the process of
   looking for a dependency and aborting the build if an already installed
   variant of the dependency can not be located.
   
   :param name: The name of the dependency we are looking for.
   :type name: desc
   :param **kwargs: Keyword arguments describing the behavior of the search. See
      the documentation for _fob_parse_arguments for a complete list.
   
   :raises UNKNOWN_PM: When ``pm_name`` does not correspond to a known package
       manager. Strong throw guarantee.
