.. module:: cmaize.user_api/dependencies/impl_/get_package_manager


.. function:: _fob_get_package_manager(_gpm_pm _gpm_project _gpm_pm_name)

   Wraps the process of retrieving a package manager from a project.
   
   At the moment it is somewhat non-trivial to go from a package maanger name,
   e.g., ``cmake`` or ``pip`` to an actual ``ProjectManager`` object which has
   been registered with a project. This function wraps that process.
   
   :param pm: The variable the package manager will be assigned to.
   :type pm: PackageManager*
   :param project: The project that the package manager will be registered with.
   :type project: CMaizeProject
   :param pm_name: The name of the package manager to retrieve.
   :type pm_name: desc
   
   :raises UNKNOWN_PM: When ``pm_name`` does not correspond to a known package
       manager. Strong throw guarantee.
