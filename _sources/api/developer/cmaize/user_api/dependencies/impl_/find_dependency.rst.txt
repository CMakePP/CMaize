.. module:: cmaize.user_api/dependencies/impl_/find_dependency


.. function:: _cmaize_find_dependency(_fd_tgt _fd_pm _fd_package_specs _fd_project _fd_name)

   Factorization from cmaize_find_dependency and cmaize_find_or_build_dependency.
   
   The first part of both cmaize_find_dependency and
   cmaize_find_or_build_dependency is the same. This function factors that common
   code out into one function.
   
   :param tgt: The variable to hold the target that was found. Will be empty if
      no target was found.
   :type tgt: CMaizeTarget*
   :param pm: The variable to hold the package manager we looked inside of.
   :type pm: PackageManager*
   :param package_specs: The variable to hold the package specification we looked
      for.
   :type package_specs: PackageSpecification*
   :param project: The CMaize project this find operation is associated with.
   :type project: CMaizeProject
   :param name: The name of the dependency we are looking for.
   :type name: desc
   :param **kwargs: The arguments to forward to _fob_parse_arguments. See
      _fob_parse_arguments documentation for more details.
   
   :raises UNKNOWN_PM: When ``pm_name`` does not correspond to a known package
       manager. Strong throw guarantee.
