.. module:: cmaize.user_api/dependencies/impl_/find_dependency


.. function:: _cmaize_find_dependency(_fd_tgt _fd_pm _fd_package_specs _fd_project _fd_name)

   Checks if dependency is already installed.
   
   Factorization from cmaize_find_dependency and cmaize_find_or_build_dependency.
   The first part of both cmaize_find_dependency and
   cmaize_find_or_build_dependency is the same. This function factors that common
   code out into one function.
