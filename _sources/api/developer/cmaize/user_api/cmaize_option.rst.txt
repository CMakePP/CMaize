.. module:: cmaize.user_api/cmaize_option


.. function:: cmaize_option(_co_name _co_default_value _co_docstring)

   Registers a configuration option with the current project.
   
   .. note::
   
      Unlike CMake's ``option`` command values are not restricted to booleans.
   
   Build system mainainers can declare configuration options for their build
   system via the ``cmaize_option`` function. Consistent with usual build sytem
   behavior, users can override the default value. Assuming a call to
   ``cmaize_option`` like
   ``cmaize_option(option_name option_value option_description)``, users of
   the build system can set the value of the ``option_name`` option by:
   
   1. setting a ``option_name`` variable before calling ``cmaize_option``,
   2. setting a ``option_name`` cache variable before calling ``cmaize_option``,
      or by
   3. setting the configuration option ``option_name`` on the project's
      CMaizeProject object directly (not recommended for end users).
   
   If the user has not set the value via any of the above mechanisms
   ``cmaize_option`` will set the value of ``option_name`` to ``option_value``.
   
   After calling this function the CMake variable ``option_name`` is guaranteed
   to be set. Similar to CMake's ``option`` command, the CMake cache variable
   ``option_name`` will be set if a normal (or cache) CMake variable
   ``option_name`` was not already set.
   
   :param name: The name of the configuration option being set.
   :type name: desc
   :param default_value: The value to set ``name`` to if the user does not
      provide a value.
   :type default_value: str
   :param docstring: A brief description of what the option does. This
      parameter's value is used primarily as metadata.
   :type docstring: str
   
   


.. function:: cmaize_option_list()

   Convenience function for registering a number of options with CMaize.
   
   Many projects have multiple configuration options. Rather than having to call
   ``cmaize_option`` for each option, ``cmaize_option_list`` allows you to
   provide a list of key/value pairs. Under the hood this function simply loops
   over the key/value pairs and forwards them to ``cmaize_option``, thus all
   documentation relating to ``cmaize_option`` applies here as well.
   
   :param *args: A variadiac list of key/value pairs. The ``2i``-th argument will
      be interpretted as the key for the ``i``-th pair and the ``2i + 1``-th
      argument will be interpretted as the value for the ``i``-th pair.
   :type *args: str
   
   :raises input_error: If the number of arguments is not divisible by 2.
