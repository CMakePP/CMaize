.. data:: _CMAIZE_TOOLCHAIN_AUTOPOPULATED_VARIABLE_NAMES

   Variables that CMaize will autopopulate in its ``Toolchain`` object.
   This variable is a list of strings representing variable names.
   

   :Default value: 

   :type: VarType.String


.. function:: cpp_class(Toolchain)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   The ``Toolchain`` class is a source code representation of the toolchain
   file that can be provided by users to specify options sent to every
   dependency.
   
   Users need a way to specify options which should be passed to every 
   dependency. By convention this is done by setting the options in a 
   toolchain file. The Toolchain class is the source code representation of 
   this file, containing values autopopulated by CMaize, as well as
   user-specified options. User options take precidence over autopopulated
   values.
   


.. function:: cpp_constructor(CTOR Toolchain)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Default constructor for Toolchain object with only autopopulated
   options available.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object constructed.
   :type self: Toolchain
   :returns: ``self`` will be set to the newly constructed ``Toolchain``
             object.
   :rtype: Toolchain
   


.. function:: cpp_constructor(CTOR Toolchain path)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Constructor for Toolchain object with a path to a toolchain file.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object constructed.
   :type self: Toolchain
   :param toolchain_path: Path to the toolchain file to load.
   :type toolchain_path: path
   :returns: ``self`` will be set to the newly constructed ``Toolchain``
             object.
   :rtype: Toolchain
   


.. function:: cpp_constructor(CTOR Toolchain str)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Constructor for Toolchain object with a string assumed to be the
   contents of an already opened toolchain file.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object constructed.
   :type self: Toolchain
   :param file_contents: Contents of the toolchain file.
   :type file_contents: str
   :returns: ``self`` will be set to the newly constructed ``Toolchain``
             object.
   :rtype: Toolchain
   


.. function:: cpp_member(generate_file_contents Toolchain str)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Generate the contents of a toolchain file.
   
   Generates a string with valid toolchain file contents based on the
   state of the toolchain object. The generated contents will contain
   the autopopulated options first, followed by the user-specified
   toolchain file, verbatim. By putting the user-specified toolchain
   file after the autopopulated options, the user-specified options
   will override any autopopulated options.
   
   If you need to write the toolchain contents to a file, use the
   ``write_file`` member function instead of ``generate_file_contents``.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object to generate toolchain file from.
   :type self: Toolchain
   :param return_value: Return value with toolchain file contents.
   :type return_value: str
   :returns: Toolchain file content string.
   :rtype: str
   


.. function:: cpp_member(write_toolchain Toolchain path)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Writes the toolchain object contents to a toolchain file.
   
   If the contents of this toolchain file are needed, they can be
   generated directly with the ``generate_file_contents`` member
   function.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object to create toolchain file from.
   :type self: Toolchain
   :param toolchain_path: Location to write toolchain file. This should
                          include the toolchain file name as well.
   :type toolchain_path: path
   


.. function:: cpp_member(_autopopulate_options Toolchain)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Autopopulates certain toolchain variables as default values to be used
   if not specified by the user toolchain file.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object to autopopulate.
   :type self: Toolchain
   


.. function:: cpp_member(__initialize Toolchain)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Initialize empty option maps of the Toolchain object and autopopulates
   some options.
   
   :param self: Toolchain object to initialize.
   :type self: Toolchain
