   .. note:: This is a macro, and so does not introduce a new scope.

   Fetches and makes a dependency available to the main project
   
   This function is code-factorization for the common scenario in which we want
   to declare a dependency (and how to obtain that dependency) and immediately
   make that dependency available to the project. This function is ultimately a
   thin wrapper around ``FetchContent_Declare`` and
   ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable``.
   
   :param _faa_name: The name of the dependency we are making available. This
                     should be the dependency's official name as it would be used
                     by other projects.
   :type _faa_name: desc
   :param *args: The additional arguments to forward to ``FetchContent_Declare``.
