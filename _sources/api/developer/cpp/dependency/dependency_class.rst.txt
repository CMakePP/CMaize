.. module:: cpp.dependency/dependency_class.cmake


.. function:: cpp_class(Dependency)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Models a dependency of the main CMake Project.
   
   The base class is for dependencies which behave close to ideal (from the
   standpoint of CMake). In particular we assume the dependency:
   
   - can be found by calling ``find_package`` in ``CONFIG`` mode
   - added to the main project's build step via CMake's fetch command
   - exports a CMake target
   
   


.. function:: cpp_member(_search_paths Dependency desc)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Computes a list of path prefixes which should be used when searching.
   
   This function encapsulates assembling a list of all the prefixes which
   should be considered when looking for this dependency.
   
   :param _sp_this: The Dependency instance being used to assemble the paths.
   :type _sp_this: Dependency
   :param _sp_result: Name for variable which will hold the result.
   :type _sp_result: desc
   


.. function:: cpp_member(find_dependency Dependency desc)


   .. warning:: This is a generic command invocation. It is not a function or macro definition.

   Attempts to locate the dependency
