## Function for processing the ``<Name>_FOUND`` variable of ``find_package``
#
# CMake's ``find_package`` function returns the result via ``<Name>_FOUND``
# variable. While convention is that the capitalization of the package's name
# in the variable matches the capitialization used to call ``find_package``,
# particularly when ``find_package`` is used in "module" mode, this is not
# always the case. This function will loop over possible capitalizations in an
# attempt to better ensure we find the results of ``find_package``.
#
# .. note::
#
#     This function should be considered a protected member function of the
#     FindRecipe class.
#
# :param handle: A handle to the FindRecipe instance we are assessing the
#                found-ness of.
#
# :CMake Variables:
#
#     * *<Name>_FOUND* - Here ``<Name>`` matches the input capitalization. This
#       variable will be considered as one possible output of ``find_package``.
#     * *<NAME>_FOUND* - Here ``<NAME>`` is the name in all uppercase letters.
#       This variable will be considered as one possible output of
#       ``find_package``.
#     * *<name>_FOUND* - Here ``<name>`` is the name in all lowercase letters.
#       This variable will be considered as one possible output of
#       ``find_package``.
