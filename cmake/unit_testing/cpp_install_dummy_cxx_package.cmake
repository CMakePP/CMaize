## Function for creating and installing a dummy C++ package.
#
# This function piggybacks off of :ref:`cpp_dummy_cxx_package-label`. After the
# package is created this function additionally calls :ref:`cpp_run_sub_build`
# to build the package. The resulting package is installed to
# ``<prefix>/install``. Note that the resulting package is installed with a
# config file that can locate it. For installing a less well written library
# consider :ref:`cpp_install_naive_cxx_package`.
#
# :param prefix: The directory in which the package should be generated.
#
# :kwargs:
#
#     * *NAME* - The name of the package. Defaults to "dummy".
