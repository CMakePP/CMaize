## Function for creating a C++ package for testing purposes.
#
# This function uses :ref:`cpp_dummy_cxx_library-label` to generate C++ source
# code for a simple library. In addition to the source code, this function also
# creates a ``CMakeLists.txt`` that can be used to build the package. The
# resulting ``CMakeLists.txt`` is written in terms of CPP commands and will
# create config files for finding the dependency upon installation. For testing
# less well written CMake projects use :ref:`cpp_naive_cxx_package-label`.
#
# :param prefix: The directory where the package will be created. The source for
#     the resulting package will reside at ``<prefix>/<name>``.
#
# :kwargs:
#
#     * *NAME* (``option``) - The name of the package we are creating. Defaults
#       to dummy.
