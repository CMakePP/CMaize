# Code factorization for checking that a user passed the name of a flag.
#
# The various ``optional_dependency`` functions are tied to a configuration flag
# which determines whether the option is enabled or not. Users need to provide
# those functions with the name of the flag NOT its value. This function wraps
# the error-checking logic for ensuring that users passsed the value.
#
# :param flag: Should be the name of a variable.
# :type flag: desc
#
# :raises RUNTIME_ERROR: If ``flag`` is not the name of a variable. In
#    particular we check for empty strings and truth-y/false-y values.
