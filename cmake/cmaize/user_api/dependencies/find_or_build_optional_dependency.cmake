#[[[
# Wraps the process of finding, or building, an optional dependency.
#
# This method is largely the same as cmaize_find_optional_dependency, but
# instead wraps a call to ``cmaize_find_or_build_dependency``.
#
# :param name: The name of the dependency.
# :type name: desc
# :param flag: The variable to use as a flag. Used to name the compile
#    definition.
# :type flag: desc
# :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to forward to
#    ``cmaize_find_or_build_dependency``. See the documentation for
#    ``cmaize_find_or_build_dependency`` for the full list.
#
# :raises UNKNOWN_PM: ``PACKAGE_MANAGER`` does not correspond to a known
#     package manager. Strong throw guarantee.
