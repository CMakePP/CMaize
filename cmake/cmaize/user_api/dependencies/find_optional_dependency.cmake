#[[[
# Wraps the process of finding an optional dependency.
#
# Many build systems have optional dependencies. The inclusion of the dependency
# is usually controlled with a flag (e.g., a variable like ``ENABLE_XXX`` for
# an optional dependency ``XXX``). Because of CMake's verbose nature the logic
# for whether or not the dependency is enabled is usually needed in a few
# places. CMaize is capable of automatically propagating the logic for the
# user, as long as the user tells CMaize the flag that controls the inclusion of
# of the dependency.
#
# When the dependency is enabled this function essentially wraps
# ``cmaize_find_dependency`` and the user should consult the documentation for
# ``cmaize_find_dependency`` to understand the full set of options. When enabled
# CMaize will add a compile definition to the target with the same name as the
# flag (common practice for optional dependencies is to use such a definition
# for enabling/disabling sections of source code).
#
# When the dependency is disabled this function simply creates an interface
# target to serve as a placedholder for the dependency. The interface target
# has no state and linking to/installing the target does nothing.
#
# :param name: The name of the dependency.
# :type name: desc
# :param flag: The variable to use as a flag. Used to name the compile
#    definition.
# :type flag: desc
# :param kwargs: Keyword arguments to forward to ``cmaize_find_dependency``.
#    See the documentation for ``cmaize_find_dependency`` for the full list.
#
# :raises PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND: CMaize was unable to locate the package specified.
#     Strong throw guarantee.
# :raises UNKNOWN_PM: ``PACKAGE_MANAGER`` does not correspond to a known
#     package manager. Strong throw guarantee.
